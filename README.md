# Fighting Fighters
Fighting Fighters is the group final project for my CS290 Web Development class.
It's a 1v1 card fighting game with multiple classes to choose from.

# Credits
Joshua Knowles handled practically all of the javascript for this site, his contributions go from game balancing and card creation to basic data tracking.

Ellie Ding crafted and managed mostly all of the server handling that this site uses, this also involves the json file management as well as the statistics page html, css, and backend.

Trevor Smith was the head of both CSS and game art. His contributions made the game look as nice as it does (same with the macro styling and color scheme of the entire project).

Brendan Laus was in charge of most of the html for this site, as well as a small bit of css and js for certain pages, like the character selection screen, menu, and credits page.
